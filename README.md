# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains a series of projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. These projects showcase proficiency in JavaScript programming and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Projects

### 1. Palindrome Checker
A JavaScript program that determines whether a given string is a palindrome or not. It ignores special characters and punctuation while checking for palindromes.

### 2. Roman Numeral Converter
A utility function that converts Arabic numerals to Roman numerals. It covers numbers up to 3999 and follows the standard Roman numeral conventions.

### 3. Caesar's Cipher
An implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm, which shifts the letters of a string by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

### 4. Telephone Number Validator
A JavaScript function that validates whether a given string is a valid US phone number. It checks against the standard US phone number format.

### 5. Cash Register
A program that calculates the change due to customers after a purchase. It takes the total price and the amount paid by the customer and calculates the change using the available denominations in the cash register.

## Certification and Skills Demonstrated
